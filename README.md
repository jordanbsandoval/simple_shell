In computing, the term shell is used to refer to those programs that provide a user interface to access the services of the operating system. These can be graphics or plain text, depending on the type of interface they use. Shells are designed to facilitate the way in which the different programs available on the computer are invoked or executed.

It should be noted that there are 2 types of Shell and these are:

**Common text shells** like bash, emacs, Windows command prompt, among others.

**Common graphical shells** such as GNome, KDE, XFCE, LXDE, Unity, MacOS Desktop Environment, Windows Desktop, among others.
